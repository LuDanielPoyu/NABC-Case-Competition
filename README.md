# NABC-Case-Competition
Below are the presentations and projects that we worked through in the different stages of the competition.
The first presentation slides is the first stage of the competition, which is a mock competition. The business case would be handed to us first for us to prepare the presentation.
The second presentation slides is the final competition, we got the business case in the morning and had to pitch a presentation with full insights to the judges.
